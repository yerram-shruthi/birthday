    <h1>🎁 A Special Surprise for You, Kanna! 🎁</h1>
    <p>Kanna, you have been more than just a friend — you’ve been my family, my guide, my pillar of support. Through every up and down, you’ve been the one constant in my life. 💕 It’s with this love and gratitude that I wanted to surprise you with something permanent, a token to remind you of how much you mean to me.</p>
    <p>I got a tattoo of your name, a symbol of our bond that cannot be broken. It’s a constant reminder that no matter where life takes us, our friendship will remain forever. ✨</p>
    <p>From the first day we met to now, you’ve become more than just a friend; you’ve become my other half, my guiding star. I want to remember every second, every moment we shared, so I will always carry a piece of you with me. 💌</p>
